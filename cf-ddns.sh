# modified by jfro from http://www.cnysupport.com/index.php/linode-dynamic-dns-ddn$
# Update: changed because the old IP-service wasn't working anymore
# Uses curl to be compatible with machines that don't have wget by default
# modified by Ross Hosman for use with cloudflare.
# modified by Jon Egerton to add logging
# modified by Jon Egerton to update to cloud flare api v4 (see https://api.cloudflare.com)
#
# This version is working as at 8-Aug-2018
# As/When cloudflare change their API amendments may be required
# Latest versions of these scripts are here: https://github.com/jonegerton/cloudflare-ddns
#
# To schedule:
# run `crontab -e` and add next line (without the leading #):
# */5 * * * * bash {set file location here}/cf-ddns.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
# this will run the script every 5 minutes. The IP is cached, so requests are only sent 
# when the WAN IP has changed. Log output is minimal, so shouldn't grow too large.
#
# Use strictly at your own risk
